# Linkshare Web App

Linkshare is a web app that is very similar to Hacker News or Reddit, where users post links to latest new articles that are
viewable to everyone. Users can upvote posts and also comment on them. Comments can be upvoted as well.

I made this web application in an attempt to learn Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. I have also used AngularJS 1.5 for
the front end. The REST API is all Node and Express with MongoDB as the database. I am also using Passport.js for authentication
of users.
